# Sign-in page
I have designed a simple web page for user sign-in using HTML and CSS. This clean and user-friendly page includes the following key feature:

1. **Form**: The main content of the page is a well-structured form. This form includes the following fields:
+   *Name Field:* A text input field for the user's name.
+   *Email Field:* A text input field for the user's email address.
+   *Password Field:* A password input field for the user's password, which hides the entered characters for security.
+   *Confirm Password Field:* Another password input field to confirm the user's password, ensuring accuracy during sign-up.
+   *Submit Button:* Beneath the form fields, there is a clearly labeled "Sign In" or "Submit" button, which users can click to complete the sign-in process.

2. **CSS Styling:** The page has been styled using CSS to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing design. This may include setting colors, fonts, and layout to enhance the overall user experience.

3. **Responsive Design:** The web page design is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile platforms.

The design prioritizes simplicity, usability and ensuring that users can easily sign in and access the intended services or content.
